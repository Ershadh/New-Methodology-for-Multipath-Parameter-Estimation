# New-Modeling-Methodology-for-Multipath-Parameter-Estimation
The code files attached here gives a glimpse on how to solve some of the sophisticated problems in the signal parameter estimation such as extraction of the **Multipath Profiles from Raw Data** and identification of the clusters using **Cluster Identification Algorithm** in a *very simplistic manner* based on the paper > ["A New Modeling Methodology for Multipath Parameter Estimation in Ultra Wideband Channels"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8852816) I authored and published in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation.

The measurement datasets are *actual radio measurements* obtained from the University of Southern California's [Database](http://ultra.usc.edu/uwb_database/). These measurement datasets are pre-processed and organized into data structures for a more managable access to the data. The results presented here showcase the code written for the elicitation of the proposed results.
