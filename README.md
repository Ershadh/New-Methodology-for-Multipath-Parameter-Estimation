# New-Modeling-Methodology-for-Multipath-Parameter-Estimation
The code files attached here demonstrates how to extract **Multipath Profiles from Raw Data** and identify clusters using **Cluster Identification Algorithm** based on the published paper > ["A New Modeling Methodology for Multipath Parameter Estimation in Ultra Wideband Channels"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8852816) in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation.

The measurement datasets are *actual radio measurements* obtained from the University of Southern California's [Database](http://ultra.usc.edu/uwb_database/)
The results presented here showcase the code written for the elicitation of the proposed results.
